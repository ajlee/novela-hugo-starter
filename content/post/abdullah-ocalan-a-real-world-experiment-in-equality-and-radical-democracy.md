As everyone is aware by now, the police murder of George Floyd led to an outpouring of anger towards daily violence towards black people and ethnic minorities and towards the racist structures and ideologies in society. Black Lives Matter protests have gone global and the throwing of the statue of Edward Colston, whose only claim to fame was enslaving and killing tens of thousands of black people,  has shone a vital spotlight on the horrific and brutal history of British colonialism, a history that many people in this country are never taught about. Education systems across the UK pay little attention to crimes of the British Empire, and non-Western authors that criticise priveliged white ideas are given little attention and often excluded from mainstream journals for being too critical. Many ideas and viewpoints in academia are based on assumptions of European dominance. Ignoring this results continued domination and injustice. It is the duty of white men like myself to recognise our privilege. This is why decolonising PGRs in SASS have been talking about ways to respond, and one of these ways is to feature different non-Western authors that we want to highlight.

### Abdullah Öcalan

I have only recently come across Abdullah Öcalan. I had heard his name before in relation to the Kurdish struggle before but I knew little about him. I knew vaguely that the Kurdish people have been experimenting with new forms of direct democracy, and has been fighting amazingly successfully against ISIS. I also was aware that women fighters were a core part of their revolutionary army. So a couple of weeks ago I bought a book by Öcalan _Kuridstan, Woman’s Revolution and Democratic Confederalism_ (2017) \[link to Pluto Press\] because I wanted to know more about his ideas that are central to the Kurdish revolution.

I think just reading the foreward by Nadje Ali-Ali convinced me that this book is may be invaluable to my PhD. In many countries in the world, democracies are breaking down and people are looking to strong-man racist and authoritarian leaders for answers. And yet in the Middle East, an area that is usually dismissed a by arrogant Western academics, there is an real-world experiment in a new type of direct democracy. Not only that, but it has done so while rejecting the need for a Kurdish nation-state, and putting women’s empowerment and equality at the center of this revolution, saying "a country can't be free unless the women are free" (p.xxi). Öcalan, one of the founding members of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) is the main philosophical leader behind the revolution. However, the majority of this revolution has occurred while Öcalan has been imprisoned by Turkey’s warmongering leader, Erdogan, on ridiculous and unproven charges. During his time in the Imrali prison on on island in the Marmara Sea, from 1999 to today, and 18 years of which were in solitary confinement, he has remained writing and reading and inspiring the Kurdish people. In my research I plan to look at radical democracy in relation to conservation projects, and if I do, I must refer to this real-world radical democratic project that may show us the way to create a better world.
